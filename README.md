This single-page web app is running here: https://cs.lth.se/pgk/kaptenalloc

There you can filter the schedule of this course: https://cs.lth.se/pgk

The allocation data was created by the closed source terminal app called [Kapten Alloc](http://www.nissepedia.com/index.php/Kapten_Haddocks_samlade_svordomar) that solves the hard problem of scheduling under constraints using the fantastic [Scala 3](https://scala-lang.org/) with [Scala JS](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/tutorial/basic/).
